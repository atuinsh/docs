## Recommended installation approach

Let's get started! First up, you will want to install Atuin. The recommended
approach is to use the installation script, which automatically handles the
installation of Atuin including the requirements for your environment. 


It will install a binary to `~/.atuin/bin`, and if you'd rather do something else 
then the manual steps below offer much more flexibility.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh
```

## Manual installation

### Installing the binary

If you don't wish to use the installer, the manual installation steps are as follows.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Cargo">
        It's best to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to get setup with a Rust
        toolchain, then you can run:

        ```shell
        cargo install atuin
        ```

        Please note that this requires the protobuf compiler to be installed
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Homebrew">
        ```shell
        brew install atuin
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="MacPorts">
        Atuin is also available in [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/atuin/)

        ```shell
        sudo port install atuin
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Nix">
        This repository is a flake, and can be installed using `nix profile`:

        ```shell
        nix profile install "github:atuinsh/atuin"
        ```

        Atuin is also available in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs):

        ```shell
        nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA atuin
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Pacman">
        Atuin is available in the Arch Linux [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/atuin/):

        ```shell
        pacman -S atuin
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="XBPS">
        Atuin is available in the Void Linux [repository](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/tree/master/srcpkgs/atuin):

        ```shell
        sudo xbps-install atuin
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Termux">
        Atuin is available in the Termux package repository:

        ```shell
        pkg install atuin
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="zinit">
        Atuin is installable from github-releases directly:

        ```shell
        # line 1: `atuin` binary as command, from github release, only look at .tar.gz files, use the `atuin` file from the extracted archive
        # line 2: setup at clone(create init.zsh, completion)
        # line 3: pull behavior same as clone, source init.zsh
        zinit ice as"command" from"gh-r" bpick"atuin-*.tar.gz" mv"atuin*/atuin -> atuin" \
            atclone"./atuin init zsh > init.zsh; ./atuin gen-completions --shell zsh > _atuin" \
            atpull"%atclone" src"init.zsh"
        zinit light atuinsh/atuin
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Source">
        Atuin builds on the latest stable version of Rust, and we make no
        promises regarding older versions. We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin.git
        cd atuin/crates/atuin
        cargo install --path .
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="caution" title="Please be advised">
    If you choose to manually install Atuin rather than using the recommended installation script,
    merely installing the binary is not sufficient, you should also set up the shell plugin.
</Aside>

### Installing the shell plugin

Once the binary is installed, the shell plugin requires installing.
If you use the install script, this should all be done for you!
After installing, remember to restart your shell.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="zsh">
        ```shell
        echo 'eval "$(atuin init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
        ```

        <Tabs>
            <TabItem label="zinit">
                ```shell
                # if you _only_ want to install the shell-plugin, do this; otherwise look above for a "everything via zinit" solution
                zinit load atuinsh/atuin
                ```
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="Antigen">
                ```shell
                antigen bundle atuinsh/atuin@main
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="bash">
        <Tabs>
            <TabItem label="ble.sh">
                Atuin works best in bash when using [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh).

                With ble.sh installed and loaded in `~/.bashrc`, just add atuin to your `~/.bashrc`

                ```shell
                echo 'eval "$(atuin init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
                ```
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="bash-preexec">
                [Bash-preexec](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec) can also be used, but you may experience
                 some minor problems with the recorded duration and exit status of some commands.

                <Aside type="caution" title="Please note">
                    bash-preexec currently has an issue where it will stop honoring `ignorespace`.
                    While Atuin will ignore commands prefixed with whitespace, they may still end up in your bash history.
                    Please check your configuration! All other shells do not have this issue.

                    To use Atuin in `bash < 4` with bash-preexec, the option `enter_accept` needs
                    to be turned on (which is so by default).

                    bash-preexec cannot properly invoke the `preexec` hook for subshell commands
                    `(...)`, function definitions `func() { ...; }`, empty for-in-statements `for
                    i in; do ...; done`, etc., so those commands and duration may not be recorded
                    in the Atuin's history correctly.
                </Aside>

                To use bash-preexec, download and initialize it

                ```shell
                curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec/master/bash-preexec.sh -o ~/.bash-preexec.sh
                echo '[[ -f ~/.bash-preexec.sh ]] && source ~/.bash-preexec.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
                ```

                Then setup Atuin

                ```shell
                echo 'eval "$(atuin init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="fish">
        Add

        ```shell
        atuin init fish | source
        ```

        to your `is-interactive` block in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Nushell">
        Run in *Nushell*:

        ```shell
        mkdir ~/.local/share/atuin/
        atuin init nu | save ~/.local/share/atuin/init.nu
        ```

        Add to `config.nu`:

        ```shell
        source ~/.local/share/atuin/init.nu
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="xonsh">
        Add
        ```shell
        execx($(atuin init xonsh))
        ```
        to the end of your `~/.xonshrc`
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Upgrade

Run `atuin-update`, and if that command is not available, run the install script again.

If you used a package manager to install Atuin, then you should also use your package manager to update Atuin.

## Uninstall

If you'd like to uninstall Atuin, please check out [this page](https://docs.atuin.sh/uninstall/).
