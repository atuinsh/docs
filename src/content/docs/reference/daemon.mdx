# `atuin daemon`
_This is experimental!_

The Atuin daemon is a background daemon designed to

1. Speed up database writes
2. Allow machines to sync when not in use, so they're ready to go right away
3. Perform background maintenance

It may also work around issues with ZFS/SQLite performance.

It's currently experimental, but is safe to use with a little bit of setup

## To enable

Add the following to the bottom of your Atuin config file

```toml
[daemon]
enabled = true
```

Then, run `atuin daemon`. This might make sense in a tmux session, systemd unit, etc. Once it's ready for wider use, we will handle this setup for you.

## Extra config

See the [config section](/configuration/config/#daemon)
