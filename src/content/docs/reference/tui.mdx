# Configuration

There is limited support for customizing these via the [config](/configuration/config).

# Default keybindings.

The code for this lives in [atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/main/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs)

## All modes

 * esc, ctrl-c, ctrl-g, ctrl-[: quit without choosing anything
 * tab: accept command but allow for editing
 * ctrl-o: inspect the currently selected command.

## Search mode.

Basic readline keybindings are supported (ctrl-b, ctrl-a, ctrl-e, etc).

 * ctrl-r: Change filter mode between Global, Host, Session, Directory, and Workspace.
 * ctrl-s: Change search mode.
