## `atuin import`

Atuin can import your history from your "old" history file

`atuin import auto` will attempt to figure out your shell (via \$SHELL) and run
the correct importer

Unfortunately these older files do not store as much information as Atuin does,
so not all features are available with imported data.

Except as noted otherwise, you can set the `HISTFILE` environment variable to
control which file is read, otherwise each importer will try some default filenames.

```
HISTFILE=/path/to/history/file atuin import zsh
```

Note that for shells such as Xonsh that store history in many files rather than a
single file, `$HISTFILE` should be set to the directory in whic those files reside.

For formats that don't store timestamps, timestamps will be generated starting at
the current time plus 1ms for each additional command in the history.

Most importers will discard commands found that have invalid UTF-8.

## bash

This will read the history from `$HISTFILE` or `$HOME/.bash_history`.

Warnings will be issued if timestamps are found to be out of order, which could also
happen when a history file starts without timestamps but later entries include them.

## fish

fish supports multiple history sessions, so the importer will default to the `fish`
session unless the `fish_history` environment variable is set. The file to be read
will be `{session}_history` in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/` (or `$HOME/.local/share/fish`).

Not all of the data in the fish history is preserved, some data about filenames used
for each command are not used by Atuin, so it is discarded.

## nu-hist-db

This importer reads from Nushell's SQLite history database, which is stored in 
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nushell/history.sqlite3` or `$HOME/.config/nushell/history.sqlite3`.
There is no way to set the filename otherwise.

## nu

This importer reads from Nushell's text history format, which is stored in 
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nushell/history.txt` or `$HOME/.config/nushell/history.txt`.
There is no way to set the filename otherwise.

## resh

The [RESH](https://github.com/curusarn/resh) importer will read from `$HISTFILE` or `$HOME/.resh_history.json`.

## xonsh

The Xonsh importer will read from all JSON files it finds in the Xonsh history
directory. The location of the directory is determined as follows:
* If `$HISTFILE` is set, its value is used as the history directory.
* If `$XONSH_DATA_DIR` is set (as it typically will be if the importer is invoked
from within Xonsh), `$XONSH_DATA_DIR/history_json` is used.
* If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/xonsh/history_json` is used.
* Otherwise, `$HOME/.local/share/xonsh/history_json` is used.

Not all data present in Xonsh history JSON files is used by Atuin. Xonsh stores the
environment variables present when each session was initiated, but this data is
discarded by Atuin. Xonsh optionally stores the output of each command; if present
this data is also ignored by Atuin.

## xonsh_sqlite

The Xonsh SQLite importer will read from the Xonsh SQLite history file. The history
file's location is determined by the same process as the regular Xonsh importer,
but with `history_json` replaced by `xonsh-history.sqlite`.

The Xonsh SQLite backend does not store environment variables, but like the JSON
backend it can optionally store the output of each command. As with the JSON backend,
if present this data will be ignored by Atuin.

## zsh_histdb

This will read the Zsh histdb SQLite file from `$HISTDB_FILE` or
`$HOME/.histdb/zsh-history.db`.

## zsh

This will read the Zsh history from `$HISTFILE` or `$HOME/.zhistory`
or `$HOME/.zsh_history` in either the simple or extended format.
